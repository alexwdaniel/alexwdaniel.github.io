Hi, I'm Alex. I have been developing professionally for about 2 years working primarily
with **Ruby on Rails** and **AngularJS**. I have done some work in iOS with **Objective-C/Swift**
and have recently become interested in Elixir and functional web development.

I am co-founder of [Findum Inc](http://www.findum.com), a local search startup designed to enable local
shoppers to search and explore local businesses and inventory in their
cities and neighborhoods.

I worked as a Ruby on Rails developer at [ReverbNation](https://www.reverbnation.com/),
a Durham, North Carolina based company working to empower millions of emerging Artists
develop their careers with online marketing tools and A&R services to connect with fans and industry.

In 2013, I graduated from [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Science and
Minor in Finance.
