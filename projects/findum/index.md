###Platforms

(UM) Local Search is powered by two major platforms:

####1. Storefronts

Findum Storefronts make all local businesses instantaneously visible and searchable in their communities. Findum Storefront’s enable local businesses to easily create searchable, online storefronts. Using Lists and Collections, local businesses can quickly create itemized lists and browsable collections to instantly showcase new and existing inventory. Storefront Lists and Collections are unique, highly flexible, and powerful tools; each item in any List or Collection becomes instantly searchable, whether it is a pair of running shoes, a pulled pork slider appetizer, a weekend special pruning service, or blues show at a local cafe. Lists and Collections enable inventory information to instantaneously reach local shoppers, giving local businesses instant visibility.

#####Unique Features

*Locally Sourced:* With *Locally Sourced*, communities can discover the resources that exist around them and explore how local businesses work together to create rich products, services, and experiences in their local economies. *Locally Sourced* provides links to the sourcing and service partners of each local business, displaying a storefront photo, the business name, what is sourced, and a link to the business’s Findum storefront. Local shoppers can browse these connections on each storefront page. For local businesses, *Locally Sourced* gives local businesses an opportunity to promote their partners, as well as be promoted in return. Businesses can support their local economic community by cross-providing exposure to new and existing networks of customers.

*Mobile Location Tracker:* For mobile businesses, location is displayed in real-time on their storefront map. Using Findum’s [mobile location application](https://github.com/findum/Location) (iOS). Mobile businesses can quickly gather and publish their mobile location to their storefront.

*Brands List:* Each storefront features a list of the brands carried in-store with a searchable brands list.

####2. The Local Dashboard

The Local Dashboard is a tool for local search, exploration, and discovery. Locals can create collections of businesses and use the Dashboard to explore cities and neighborhoods. The Local Dashboard is a powerful tool for locals to connect and follow the businesses they love and to discover and explore their cities, neighborhoods, and communities.

####Future Development

(UM) is a partial but strategic solution to the problem of local search. Storefronts, Lists, and Collections provide a simple, nimble, and low-cost infrastructure to make local economies searchable and competitive. The next step is real-time inventory information. Lists and Collections are a strategic solution because they can be used in any type of business and alongside any inventory management software. As we gain market share in local search we will implement a real-time solution for inventory management and search. (UM)’s future is a complete solution to the problem of local search.
