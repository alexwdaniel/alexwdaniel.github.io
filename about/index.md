Hi, I'm Alex. I have been developing professionally for about 2 years working primarily
with **Ruby on Rails** and **AngularJS**. I have done some work in iOS with **Objective-C/Swift**
and have recently become interested in Elixir and functional web development.

I am co-founder of <a href="https://www.findum.com" class="mxp-link" target="_blank">Findum, Inc</a>,
a local search startup designed to enable local shoppers to search and explore
local businesses and inventory in their cities and neighborhoods.

I worked as a Ruby on Rails developer at <a href="https://www.reverbnation.com/" class="mxp-link" target="_blank">ReverbNation</a>, a Durham, North Carolina based company working to empower millions of emerging Artists
develop their careers with online marketing tools and A&R services to connect with fans and industry.

In 2013, I graduated from <a href="https://www.duke.edu" class="mxp-link" target="_blank">Duke University</a>
with a B.S. in Computer Science and Minor in Finance.
