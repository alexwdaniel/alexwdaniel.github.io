Copy the error, paste it into google, and hit enter. Like most developers who have run into unexpected errors while coding, my first recourse is to paste the console output into the nearest search engine. Almost without fail, one of the top five results will be a detailed blog post or an exhaustive stack overflow thread pertaining to my exact problem. I read the article, skim the comments, and I've got the solution. Pheww.

To begin this blog, I thought it would be beneficial to enumerate my motivations. Time and time again I have relied on the labor of others to find the missing piece in a puzzle, or get me started using a new framework with a comprehensive tutorial. In that same spirit, I hope to chronicle some of the minor snags, day-long detours, and agonizing obstacles as I try to compel this brushed aluminum box to do my bidding.

My principal motivation is to produce an account of the supremely interesting and at times frustrating tidbits of software development. Regardless of experience level, starting a new project or learning a different framework can come with a steep learning curve. You are bound to run into some sort of obstacle, likely one that seems so trivial you may begin to question your sanity. It might be a peculiar language feature or incorrect configuration setting. We have all spent hours staring at a problem, only to return to it a few days later and immediately see the solution. Taking the time to document the problem and pertinent concepts will be invaluable, when inevitably a couple months or even several years down the line you encounter a similar situation.

While helping yourself is all well and good, helping someone else, possibly someone further behind you in their evolution as a developer, is another great reason. I have been working professionally doing Ruby on Rails development for about two years. In that short amount of time, I have grown tremendously both by virtue of experience, running into a variety to difficulties along the way, and by reading and learning from others who have taken the time to chronicle their programming knowledge.

I have tried to start a development journal several times before, each time putting it off in favor of learning something new or writing more code. While it is easy to rationalize that choice as a better use of time, the reality is that it is easier. Programming is fun; writing coherent sentences, thatâ€™s hard. Part of becoming an expert software craftsman involves communicating that knowledge effectively to others. While coding examples and sample applications are a great way to convey that expertise, there is nothing more difficult than spelling out that same concept in intelligible sentences.

Whether or not this blog is helpful to others, I plan to continue learning and try to have some fun along the way.
